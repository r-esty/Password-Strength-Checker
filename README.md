# Password Strength Checker

A simple JavaScript-based password strength checker I made that evaluates user inputs and provides feedback on password strength along with improvement tips.

- **Real-time Password Evaluation**: As users type their password, the application evaluates its strength instantly.
- **Strength Indicators**: Displays password strength as "Very Weak," "Weak," "Good," or "Strong."
- **Helpful Tips**: Provides suggestions to improve password strength based on user input.
